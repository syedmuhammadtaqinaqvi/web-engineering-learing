🌐 Web Engineering Learning Journey

Hands-on HTML, CSS & JavaScript Practice Repo

Welcome to my Web Engineering Learning Repository — a collection of practical exercises, mini-projects, and core concepts that I’m exploring as I learn the foundations of front-end web development.
This repo represents my step-by-step journey into building interactive web pages, improving JavaScript logic skills, and understanding how real websites work.

📘 What This Repo Covers

This learning journey focuses on the following fundamental areas:

🔹 HTML Structure

Writing clean, semantic HTML

Linking JS files correctly

Creating forms, buttons, inputs, lists, and display elements

🔹 CSS Basics (Visual Structure)

Simple layout styling

Element spacing, buttons, input styling

Understanding how structure and style work together

🔹 JavaScript Essentials

Core logic that powers interactivity:

Working with DOM

Handling user events

Adding/removing items dynamically

Mathematical operations

Timers, strings, validation, and more

🧩 Practical Mini-Projects Included

Each mini-project helps strengthen a different JavaScript concept:

✔️ 1. Hello World Interaction

Basic DOM interaction using buttons and alerts.

✔️ 2. Simple Calculator

Input handling, mathematical evaluation, and UI updates.

✔️ 3. To-Do List App

Add/remove items dynamically using JavaScript DOM manipulation.

✔️ 4. Random Number Generator

Utilizing Math.random() for number generation.

✔️ 5. Temperature Converter

Bidirectional Celsius/Fahrenheit conversion with validation.

✔️ 6. Palindrome Checker

String cleaning, reversal, and logic testing.

✔️ 7. Digital Timer

setInterval, start/stop logic, time formatting.

✔️ 8. Dropdown Interaction

Reading selected values and updating output.

🚀 Purpose of This Repository

This repo is not just a collection of exercises — it represents:

My learning progress in Web Engineering
